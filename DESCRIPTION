Description: Permutation based test for determining the significance of
    clusters. For a full descrition of the algorithm, read the original paper:
    "A permutation test for determining significance of clusters with
    applications to spatial and gene expression data" Journal of Computational
    Statistics and Data Analysis. This package is a refactored implementation
    of Park's code. The alogorithm is unchaged. But the interface is rebuilt
    and the plotting functions modified. If you use this package, please cite
    Park et al.
